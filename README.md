# TEST-CODE-WITH-ANDROID-STUDIO
Just to expand my knowldege of Java and learn a new langauge I had started this code to make a prototype of an app idea that I used for my Deca Competiton. 
So far I have only gotten as far as the loading screen and still need to learn more about Google's firebase program to get a hang of Android Studio.
